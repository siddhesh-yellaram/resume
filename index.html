        <strong>üöß SOFTWARE ENGINEER | SWABHAV VENTURELABS</strong>
        <p>08/2021 - Present</p>
        <p>
          Implemented migrating GS Website (Known as IIMTF For Conducting Exhibitions All Over India) from Angular 8
          to Angular 13 with improving
          efficiency in analysis of Product, Exhibitor & Visitor with lots of UI and API changes & so worked
          on Agraeta (Known as BTL that has been producing innovative, world-class Kitchen Drawer Baskets and
          Accessories) with latest .NET Core 6 and angular 16
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed ticketing app firstly using Kotlin/Java and now in Flutter for fetching visitor data along with
          different processes such as unique MCC (Mega Consumer Card) which will get associated with all
          visitors who visited exhibition and did shopping and provide different gifts along with Scan QR for verifying
          tickets of visitor before entering exhibitions and different web applications such as GsWeb Online Ticketing,
          MCCQr here when visitor scans qr and enters shopping details after completing shopping at mcc counter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Served as a module leader in designing the Agraeta website (known as BTL, a company simplifying spaces with
          innovative, world-class kitchen drawer baskets and accessories in India). The website includes modules for
          managing companies, transports, cities, addresses, and user roles, which are used for adding orders and
          applying discounts based on user roles (dealer, distributor, or end-user) through login credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, collaborated with teammates to design an attendance and expense module. This module monitors
          salesperson activity in real-time by fetching their live location and city through a Flutter-based salesperson
          app. The app provides valuable insights into their orders, visits, attendance, and expense entries. Using the
          expense module, administrators can track day-wise salesperson expenses, including allocated budgets and any
          extra expenses incurred based on locations across different regions in India.

        <strong>üöß GS Team Head | SWABHAV VENTURELABS</strong>
        <p>01/24 - Present</p>
        <p>Integrated WhatsApp with the ticketing app to ensure authentic visitor verification and led the team in
          upgrading the app from Java to Flutter. The transition to Flutter was made to leverage its modern,
          cross-platform capabilities, enabling faster development, a better user experience, and easier maintenance.
          Additionally, I incorporated Bluetooth connectivity into the app, resolving errors that were prevalent in the
          old Java-based version.
        </p>
        <p>Designed and hosted a live MCC Visitor QR website application to streamline the process of adding visitor
          purchase entries. Previously, entries were recorded in Google Sheets and then manually transferred to the
          website, causing delays and duplication of effort. With this new application, interns can now directly add
          entries, eliminating the need for re-entering data and significantly saving time
